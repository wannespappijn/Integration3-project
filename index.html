          <h4 class="ancestors__intro-subtitle">Tracing its ancestry</h4>
          <p class="ancestors__intro-text">The violin, as we know it today, has evolved over centuries and has been shaped by a variety of instruments. Among the earliest ancestors of the violin, the Rebab, Rebec, and Lyra played a crucial role in its development. These instruments have contributed to the formation of the violin's distinct sound and characteristics. Through exploring the Rebab, Rebec, and Lyra, we can gain a deeper understanding of the violin's history and the evolution of its design and playing techniques.</p>

                <p class="instrument__text-text">The Rebab, a precursor to the modern violin, originated in the 8th century Middle East and spread to North Africa and Europe via trade routes. It was divided into three types: the bowed Rebab, plucked Rebab, and the Rebab with a skin-covered body. It was popular in medieval Islamic courts and traditional Arabic and Persian music, and also influenced the development of the European violin.

                <p class="instrument__text-text">The Rebec, an offshoot of the Rebab, is believed to have been introduced to Europe during the Arabic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a stringed instrument that typically has between 1 and 5 strings. It was widely popular in medieval Europe, particularly in the courts and for dance music. The Rebec was also an important instrument in the development of the European violin. It is still played today, but mostly in folk music and early music ensembles.

Variants of the Lyra are still played today, particularly in communities of the former Byzantine Empire such as Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria and Serbia. It is particularly associated with the folk music tradition of Crete where it's considered the main instrument of the island. It's also known as Byzantine lyra or a Cretan lyra.</p>

          <p class="origins__text-text">The violin as we know it today began to take shape in the 16th century in Northern Italy. People there started to experiment with instruments like the lute and other snared instruments, which led to the creation of the violin. The earliest violins were smaller and had a different sound then the one we know today. The earliest known violin, is made by Andrea Amati in 1555. It is now housed in the National Music Museum in Vermillion, South Dakota. The violin began to gain popularity among musicians and composers of that time. And has been since then one of the most played and beloved instruments in the world. The violin is an instrument with a rich history and keeps evolving even to this day.
